# liri-node-app

This is an App that that interacts with the user, to facilitate the information for:

*Searching a son in spotify
*Searching a movie in OMDB
*Bands in Town 

The problem that is solving is the lack of efficiency when it comes to browse the information by its own, as one can get lost easily in such plenty results given by Google. It also make the searching secure as you can know with certainty that this information is true.

The app is structured to interact with the user since the first moment. As it is based in prompts and selections for the user to have a better experience. 

The only thing that you have to do is enter: node liri.js in the terminal and it will respond the first question: Which action would you like to do? ; and a list of posibilities that can be chosen only by scrolling with the arrows: ["Search a song", "Search a movie", "Bands in Town"].

The technologies used by this project are:
1. VS code
2. Node.js
3. Spotify API
4. Bands in town API
5. OMDB API
6. Screencastify 
7. Javascript
